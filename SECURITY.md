# Security Policy

## Scope

This policy covers `terraform-google-n8n`, the Terraform module published
at https://registry.terraform.io/modules/n8n-io/n8n/google.

It does **not** cover:

- The n8n product itself.
- Workflows users build inside n8n.
- Google Cloud services, Kubernetes, or other upstream components this
  module provisions or installs.

If you've found something that affects the n8n product rather than
this Terraform module, please report it through n8n's product security
channel instead.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting:

1. https://github.com/n8n-io/terraform-google-n8n/security/advisories/new
2. Fill in the report. We see it; the public does not.

If you cannot use GitHub Advisories, email `security@n8n.io` with
`terraform-google-n8n` in the subject so the report routes correctly.

Please **do not** open public GitHub issues for security findings.

## Response expectations

This module is maintained by the n8n Solutions team on a best-effort
basis. There is no contractual SLA. We aim to:

- Acknowledge new reports within 5 business days.
- Provide an initial assessment (severity, scope, planned action)
  within 10 business days.
- Coordinate a fix and disclosure timeline with the reporter.

For critical issues with active exploitation, we move faster.

## Supported versions

Only the most recent minor version receives security fixes. Older
minor lines do not receive backports. See
[README.md, Stability & versioning](./README.md#stability--versioning)
for the versioning policy.

| Version | Security fixes |
| ------- | -------------- |
| 0.1.x   | ✅ (current)   |

## Out of scope for this policy

- Findings that require an attacker already inside the Google Cloud
  project or Kubernetes cluster. Hardening within an already-compromised
  environment is best-effort and not in scope.
- Findings against the third-party Helm charts this module installs
  (KEDA and the n8n chart). Report those upstream; we bump our chart
  pins once a fix is available.
- Findings against Google Cloud service defaults exposed as optional
  inputs (e.g. `redis_auth_enabled = false`). These are documented
  configuration choices, not vulnerabilities.
